# SEARCHBOX- An app that can satiate hunger and reduce food wastage

<b> PROBLEM STATEMENT </b>

There is a food scarcity for the slums of our local region. There is no current proposition to distribute food for them. We have also observed excess food wastage at places like hotels and banquet halls. Our problem statement aims at avoid food wasteage and distribute to needy ones. 


<b> PROPOSED SOLUTION </b>

  Model explanation: <br>
Our model mainly consists of three blocks: Donors block, Distribution block and Booth block. Basically the food is collected in the donors block and is distributed by the booth block setup at different locations of the region. The distribution block transports the food from the donor block to the booth block.

1) Donate <br>
Our major food benefactors are restaurants, banquet halls, hostels and other places where there is huge production of food. In these places, there is also a large amount of food which remains as leftovers. To utilize the leftover food we have designed our application. We have a feature where the donor can inform us about the remaining food. Donors could inform us about the location, quantity and the time upto which the food can be kept preserved. For verification, we have asked the donor to upload a photo of the food.   

2) Distribution<br>
In this phase, The food donated by the benefactors has to be distributed. Our distributors will now choose their location and the point where they are supposed to be going. After selecting continue, our app will show the distribution points in line. The distributor has to choose one, pick up food from the chosen point and then supply it to that food booth.

3) Food booth<br>
To distribute the food to the needy ones, We need to set up food booths. Food booths canâ€™t be set up everywhere, We aim to set up food booths at nearby slum places or where there are the utmost needy ones. After setting up the food booth, the user has to constantly record the current stocks he has and the number of stocks he still wants. This depends on the number of people present in that booth over that particular time. If at any time due to any reasons, the user does not update us regarding the stocks then there will be no supply of food to that particular booth.    
 
4) Contributors<br>
To increase the motive of food donation, We have made a page for our contributors to show how much they have contributed over a time interval. A portfolio will be created for each of our benefactors. We will constantly update the amount of stocks contributed by that contributor. This will help to promote the services provided by our contributors and will also motivate them to donate more and more.

<b> IMPACT AND SCOPE </b>


Thus this model will help reduce food wastage and food security. By collecting, sorting, storing, and distributing leftover food, the system ensures that safe and consumable food items are put to good use instead of being wasted. Also the food depicted regions will get recognised and be considered by the government. The NGOs and volunteers' reach can increase their influence among the citizens and the government, and may also involve partnerships and collaborations between various organizations and stakeholders, such as food banks, charities, government agencies, and food businesses. These partnerships can help to ensure that the system operates effectively and efficiently, and that the food is distributed to those who need it the most. Overall, a well-designed and well-implemented leftover food distribution system can have multiple benefits, including reducing food waste, addressing food insecurity, promoting sustainable practices, and having positive environmental impacts.
